## About CwC

CwC is an extensible Wayland compositor with dynamic window management based
on wlroots. Highly influenced by Awesome window manager, cwc use Lua for its
configuration and C plugin for extension.

For new users, you may want to check out [getting started][getting_started] page.

## Stability state

Crash may happen so daily driving isn't recommended unless you're okay with it
and if you encounter one please report by [creating issue][github-issue] with steps to
reproduce. I will fix it as quickly as possible because I also daily drive it and
I want my setup to be super stable.

API breaking change is documented with exclamation mark (`!`) in the commit
message as per [conventional commits specification][conventional-commits].
APIs that derived from AwesomeWM are unlikely to get a change therefore
guaranteed not to break your configuration.
